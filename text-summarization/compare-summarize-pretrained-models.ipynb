So, when someone clicks link from a shortener, it will be redirected to one of the pages in your defined groups.\n","A link rotator software or traffic rotator is a particular type of shortened link that routes your visitors to different destinations. This is sometimes also called an URL rotator or traffic rotator.\n","*The best part?*\n","Keep reading because I will explain in this guide how to rotate urls, so you can improve your marketing campaigns in 2021.\n","A link rotators are a type of shorteners that allows to rotate urls and redirects your visitors to different destinations. A link rotator allows you to redirect a visitor to different pages that you have added to the rotator when they click on your base shortened link.\n","It can be used for A/B testing, sharing traffic with different partners, or showing visitors different messages when they click on the same link more than once. This is particularly helpful when you're tracking conversions. For example, the content creator could send 50% of the traffic to destination A and 50% of the traffic to destination B. The content creator would then be able to compare the traffic sent to destination A vs. the traffic sent to destination B to determine which is most effective.\n","In summary, a content creator might use a link rotator to increase the chance that a user will end up on a site that they want them to visit by splitting the traffic to multiple destinations following different rotation rules.\n","Link rotators are usually a feature of url shorteners specially built for marketers. When you create a link rotator link, you add multiple destinations, and the amount of traffic you want to send to each. When a visitor visits the link, the link rotator's server generates a random number, and allocates a destination, in the proportion you defined.\n","A link rotator is a feature of URL shorteners that allows you to add multiple destinations, and the proportion of traffic you want to send to each. When someone visits the link, the link rotator's server generates a random number, and allocates a destination. The link rotator then chooses one of the destinations you've entered. The link rotator then redirects the user to the chosen destination, so they can access the content. This is an interesting concept that's now used by many large websites, such as YouTube, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, YouTube, Google Drive, and many more.\n","Sometimes, marketers will want to make a link rotator sticky, so that when a user clicks on a link twice, they always go to the same offer or landing page. This ensures that the visitor does not get confused and changed landing pages after clicking on a link. When a user clicks on a link twice, they always go to the same offer or landing page, you will want to make sure that the visitor doesn't get confused and change landing pages after clicking on a link.\n","Sticky link rotators work by saving a cookie on the user's browser that identifies them. When a click comes through again with that cookie attached, the link rotation service knows which destination to send them to.\n","Link rotators are a tool to drive traffic to different landing pages to test which page has a higher conversion rate. It is a very common practice for SEOs to use link rotators as a tool to rank higher within search engines. The main reason for this is that link rotators allow you to redirect traffic to different pages and test the impact of those pages on your traffic.\n","For instance, you could redirect all of your visitors to a landing page where you ask them to fill in a short survey. This is an effective way to increase conversions by having the visitors answer the survey for you. Moreover, link rotators are a great way to increase conversions by offering different types of content on your website. You can offer a list of links that redirects to different pages of your website. This way you can offer a wide range of content and increase conversions by offering different types of content.\n","Content creators can understand that people often use link rotators to see which of two landing pages (e.g. A or B) has a higher conversion rate. Some people also use link rotators to test different prices and one-time sale vs. subscription offers.\n","However link rotators are not allowed in some affiliate programs. The best way to create affiliate links is to use choice pages (interstitial landing pages) to offer visitors different storefronts for the same product. If a visitor clicks a link off a choice page to a particular product, they will go directly to the storefront of the product along with a shortener.\n","As well, content creators can understand that they would want conversion tracking if they are showing different offers to different people. Conversion tracking is the process of recording not just which URL a visitor went to, but what they purchased.\n","\"\"\""],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G98WCwIZG4A4"},"source":["# T5"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PPueF9yiG6D3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634073234524,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":29707,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Carlos Olamendy","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhQ5abnImE35Fu-BNSrmYlpO4C_dqQpuG2gjJmy5Q=s64","userId":"11004855458032977781"}}},"source":["from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gTI6EzPxHBCs"},"source":["model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-base')\n","tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-base')\n","print('tokenizer:', tokenizer)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eeuiHDV4IRv_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634073352994,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7538,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Carlos Olamendy","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhQ5abnImE35Fu-BNSrmYlpO4C_dqQpuG2gjJmy5Q=s64","userId":"11004855458032977781"}},"outputId":"8406873a-483b-430e-dbf2-83422bbe0268"},"source":["text = paragraph\n","preprocessed_text = \"summarize: \" + text\n","tokens_input = tokenizer.encode(preprocessed_text, return_tensors=\"pt\", max_length=512, truncation=True)\n","summary_ids = model.generate(tokens_input, min_length=60, max_length=180, length_penalty=4.0)\n","summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0])\n","print(summary)"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["a link rotator software or traffic rotator is a particular type of shortened link. it allows you to rotate urls and redirect visitors to different destinations. this is sometimes also called an URL rotator or traffic rotator. it can be used for A/B testing, sharing traffic with different partners.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PFrXVBLEOZ2b"},"source":["# Bart"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IEbliqqMOa_5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634073457464,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":270,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Carlos Olamendy","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhQ5abnImE35Fu-BNSrmYlpO4C_dqQpuG2gjJmy5Q=s64","userId":"11004855458032977781"}}},"source":["from transformers import pipeline"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IyGBxucwXq9L"},"source":["summarizer = pipeline('summarization', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn', tokenizer='facebook/bart-large-cnn')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nUCBx-LXOeFK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634073617406,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":45871,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Carlos Olamendy","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhQ5abnImE35Fu-BNSrmYlpO4C_dqQpuG2gjJmy5Q=s64","userId":"11004855458032977781"}},"outputId":"7675e2f4-979b-40f4-8e79-564bf25c6807"},"source":["text = paragraph\n","result = summarizer(text, min_length = round(0.1 * len(text.split(' '))), max_length = round(0.2 * len(text.split(' '))), do_sample=False)\n","print(result)"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/torch/_tensor.py:575: UserWarning: floor_divide is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version of pytorch.
